# FinTech_Exercise

My name is Malcolm. I have done many jobs in the past, including carpentry and farming. I have travelled to many countries, especially in Europe and Asia. Unfortunately, I have a very bad memory of my past.

My career goals are to eventually start my own business around tech and blockchain. In the short term I would like to work in the web3 industry as a developer/ analyst.

I chose Fintech as a career path as I have been interested in both technology and finance/ economics since a young age. I have not pursued either as a career - for some bizarre reason - and feel a structured course is essential for me to gain real proficiency.
